# **Football Training - Finding the Largest Clique**

## **Problem Statement**
A football training session consists of \( n \) players (\( n \) is an even number). In each match, all players participate, with \( n/2 \) players on each team. The coach wants to organize the teams in such a way that every pair of players has a chance to play against each other at least once (i.e., they must be in opposite teams in at least one match).

However, in practice, some players (despite the coachâ€™s efforts) always play in the same team in all matches. The largest subset of players who **always play in the same team** across all matches is called a **clique**.

The coach has already planned team lineups for the next \( m \) matches. Help him determine how far he is from achieving his goal by finding the size of the **largest clique** of players.

## **Input**
- The first line contains two integers \( n \) and \( m \) (\( 4 \leq n \leq 40,000 \), \( 1 \leq m \leq 50 \)), representing the number of players and the number of scheduled matches, respectively.
- Players are numbered from **1** to **n**.
- Each of the next \( m \) lines contains \( n \) distinct integers from the range **1 to n**, describing the team lineups for each match:
  - The **first \( n/2 \) numbers** represent the players in the first team.
  - The **last \( n/2 \) numbers** represent the players in the second team.

## **Output**
- Print a single integer representing the size of the **largest clique** of players who always play on the same team in all matches.
