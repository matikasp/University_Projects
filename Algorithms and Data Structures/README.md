# Algorithms and Data Structures

We focused on designing and implementing algorithms and data structures. Each week, we tackled simpler tasks, and we also completed two more challenging assignments: Domino and Gardens. Additionally, we had an exam with two tasks to be solved within 3 hours.

In this course, while writing the solutions, I prioritized efficiency over style and readability.
